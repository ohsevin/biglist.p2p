# biglist.p2p
Used WayBack Machine to find an archived version of: http://john.bitsurge.net/public/biglist.p2p.gz then extracted that using 7zip from [.p2p.gz] to [.p2p], hosted contents of biglist on github to meet the requirement of qBittorrent's IP Filtering option

Instructions:
##### Copy the Direct link to the RAW version of the biglist.p2p file from the repository 
##### " https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ninetyfivenorth/biglist.p2p/main/biglist.p2p "
###### Open your torrent client of choice, for this instance we are using qBittorrent
###### Find the option in the settings where it gives you the ability to add a URL for a .p2p file
###### Paste the URL we copied from above of RAW biglist.p2p into the torrent client's IP Filtering options
###### [for qBittorrent ONLY:] you may go ahead and click the refresh recycle symbol at the end of the URL field
 This will check for the .p2p file and run through it's contents to extract the list of IP addresses to block
