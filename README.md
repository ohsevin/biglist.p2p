# biglist.p2p
Used WayBack Machine to find an archived version of: http://john.bitsurge.net/public/biglist.p2p.gz then extracted that using 7zip from [.p2p.gz] to [.p2p], hosted contents of biglist on github to meet the requirement of qBittorrent's IP Filtering option

# Instructions
###### Copy the Direct link to the RAW version of the biglist.p2p file from the repository 
###### " https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ninetyfivenorth/biglist.p2p/main/biglist.p2p "
###### Open your torrent client of choice, for this instance we are using qBittorrent
###### Find the option in the settings where it gives you the ability to add a URL for a .p2p file
###### Paste the URL we copied from above of RAW biglist.p2p into the torrent client's IP Filtering options
###### [for qBittorrent ONLY:] you may go ahead and click the refresh recycle symbol at the end of the URL field
##### This will once more review for the user his or hers copy of said .p2p file provided; leading to further indepth review of said file. The user's newly aquired copy of said file, further supports the validity of exported archived used as well as the massive database aquired via assumedly by someone on 4chan and has the desire and the know-how to comprise and manage properly such a vast file as shown below. In order to quickly identify & take notice, the file must then be run using the client of your choice--to carry out the final steps of identifying, selecting and acting upon use of itself having been recently incorporated extracted in order to pursue achieving the final intent--listing the (apparently...lawlz) malicious IP addresses provided, to be denied access to said client via any network public or private.
